* lib_mips/board.c : verify if all routines apply correctly to WNDR3700v1&v2

* verify need for *reset_default() family of functions; see below

* verify need for CFG_SINGLE_FIRMWARE, especially in net/net.c and net/nmrp.c
  (maybe rewrite TFTP flashing?)

* create showflash command that shows flash layout

* change factory reset from resetting config partition (will be dropped because
  OpenWrt ignores it) to resetting rootfs_data - needs squashfs basic support
  implemented to recognize rootfs_data within rootfs

  jffs2 node "rootfs_data" has below header at the beginning of every 64kB
  erase block:
  19 85 20 03 00 00 00 0c  f0 60 dc 98 ff ff ff ff

  struct jffs2_unknown_node
  {
  	/* All start like this */
  	jint16_t magic;
  	jint16_t nodetype;
  	jint32_t totlen; /* So we can skip over nodes we don't grok */
  	jint32_t hdr_crc;
  };

  so scan memory above image until ART for these bytes and first occurence marks
  beginning of rootfs_data partition; for image length check commands imls/iminfo

* enable HW ID for WNDR3700v1 based on PCB number

* add OPENWRT_COMPAT flag which changes image to be OpenWrt/LEDE
  friendly.
  + allowed max image sizes:
    for  4M : 256k uboot +  64k env -> CFG_IMAGE_LEN = 0x003A0000 - rootfs_reserved
    for  8M : 256k uboot +  64k env -> CFG_IMAGE_LEN = 0x007A0000 - rootfs_reserved
    for  8M : 320k uboot + 128k env -> CFG_IMAGE_LEN = 0x00780000 - rootfs_reserved
    for 16M : 256k uboot +  64k env -> CFG_IMAGE_LEN = 0x00FA0000 - rootfs_reserved
    for 16M : 320k uboot + 128k env -> CFG_IMAGE_LEN = 0x00F80000 - rootfs_reserved
    assume rootfs_reserved = 128k or 256k
    UPDATE: according to OpenWRT docs, 3 eraseblocks are reserved (192k)

  + add reset rootfs_data command and function when factory defaults
    are enforced

* Fix size in below command:
